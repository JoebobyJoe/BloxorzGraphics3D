# BloxorzGraphics3D
High School Graphics project mimicking Bloxorz

Bloxorz was a 3D puzzle Flash Miniclip game where the user controls a rectangular piece on a grid of tiles and has to navigate the block to the finish tile where it has to stand up vertically. 

This is the term project that my class in High School was tasked to work on. We individually did the basic game mechanics with the help of the Professor, and then were tasked to add a feature to the game to help make it unique. I created a way for the game to read the maps from an embedded file, allowing the games to changed more easily than having them hardcoded into the program. The maps are stored in "BlockNRollSpecs.bnr" a text file where the first line is the size of the map and each character corresponds to what tile should be filled in (B blank, S start, T tile, F Finish).
